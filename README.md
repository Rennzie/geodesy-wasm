## About

Geodesy is a pure Rust library for doing coordinate transformations and conversion. Geodesy-Wasm is intended as an alternative to [Proj4.js](http://proj4js.org/) for performing coordinate transformations in the browsers.

_Note: Geodesy does not try to be a replacement for PROJ and only contains a fraction of the projects. If (like me) you only need a sub-set, this project may be of interest._

### Roadmap

1. [x] Implement bindings to the geodesy library
2. [x] Write a JS friendly wrapper around the bindings
3. [x] Proj string to geodesy_rs parser so that proj strings can be used with geodesy_wasm - completed by @busstoptaktik in the geodesy crate
4. [ ] NTv2 support
5. [ ] Usage guide and examples
6. [ ] Documentation
7. [ ] Publish v1.0.0

Contributions very much welcome!

## üö¥ Usage

### üõ†Ô∏è Build with `yarn build``

```sh
yarn build
```

### üî¨ Test in Headless Browsers with `wasm-pack test`

```sh
wasm-pack test --headless --chrome
```

### üîß Developing the JS wrapper

The wrapper is intended to abstract some of the complexities of using a wasm library - like dealing with pointers and manage some memory. The wrapper is written to provide a more familiar API for JS developers.

To develop the wrapper you must first build the wasm library:

```sh
yarn build:wrapper-dev
```

This will ensure that you get all the linting goodness from typescript.

Todo: tests etc
