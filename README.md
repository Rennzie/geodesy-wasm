## About

Lightweight wasm bindings to the [geodesy](https://github.com/busstoptaktik/geodesy/tree/0.10) library.
_Note: geodesy does not try to be a replacement for PROJ and only contains a fraction of the projects. If (like me) you only need a sub-set, this project may be of interest._

### Roadmap

1. [ ] Implement bindings to the geodesy library
2. [ ] Write a familiar interface for PROJ users who may want to use this project on the web
3. [ ] Proj string to geodesy_rs parser so that proj strings can be used with geodesy_wasm
4. [ ] Usage guide and examples
5. [ ] Documentation
6. [ ] Publish somewhere useful

Contributions very much welcome!
